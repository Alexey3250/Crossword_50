# Crossword Puzzle Generator

## About the Project

This project is an AI-powered crossword puzzle generator. It uses constraint satisfaction algorithms to automatically fill in a crossword puzzle grid with words from a given list, ensuring that all the words fit correctly and adhere to the puzzle's constraints.

### Built With

- Python
- Constraint Satisfaction Principles

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Pillow library for Python (for image generation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/crossword-generator.git
   ```
2. Install Pillow library
   ```sh
   pip install Pillow
   ```

## Usage

This project can be used to generate crossword puzzles of various sizes and complexities. Simply provide a structure file and a words file, and the AI will attempt to fill in the crossword.

### Running the Generator

Run the generator using the command:
```python
$ python generate.py data/structure1.txt data/words1.txt output.png 
```
